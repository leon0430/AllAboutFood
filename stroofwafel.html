<p>Some more appeasing types of foods you can try is a Stroopwafel. They come from the Netherlands. It is made with two very thin crunchy waffles and filled with caramel in the inside. It is one of the mos delicious cookies and is unknown to most of the world. It is meant to be eaten with hot coffee of tea so the steam can melt the caramel. Although they are not very accessible in the US they are not too difficult to make at home. It is a great cookie to make as long as you like tasty treats.</p>
